%This is the code for Intro to Matlab Variables. I will explain how to create and use variables in Matlab.
%Variables are used to store data values. In Matlab, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name.
%For Example: In order to create a variable named 'x' and assign it the value of 10, you would write the following code:
x=10;
%Note that the semicolon at the end of the line suppresses the output in the command window.
%You can also create variables to store different types of data, such as strings, arrays, and matrices.
%For Example: To create a string variable named 'name' and assign it the value 'John', you would write:
name='John';
